# Introduction

The P2P-powered crypto-to-cash protocol. 

We cover the two main ways to interact with the protocol - Gateway contract and Sender API. Paycrest's Gateway contract is a multi-chain EVM-based smart contract that helps facilitate the on-chain lifecycle of a payment order. 

It empowers users on-chain to create an off-ramp order while enabling a liquidity provider to facilitate that order at a good exchange rate. Sender API also helps users create and execute off-ramp orders but uses a receiving address.
