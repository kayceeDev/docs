# Paycrest Documentation

Paycrest contracts are multi-chain EVM-based smart contracts that facilitate the on-chain lifecycle of a payment order. They empower a sender to create a payment order, enable a liquidity provider to receive cryptocurrency in escrow, and much more. This docs covers how to use our APIs and contract to enable our off-ramp in your app.  

### Installation

```
$ yarn

### Local Development

```
$ yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.
