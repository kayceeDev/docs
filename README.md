# Paycrest Documentation

We cover the two main ways to interact with the protocol - gateway contract and sender API. Paycrest's gateway contract is a multi-chain EVM-based smart contract that helps facilitate the on-chain lifecycle of a payment order. 

It empowers users on-chain to create an off-ramp order while enabling a liquidity provider to facilitate that order at a good exchange rate. Sender API also helps users create and execute off-ramp orders but uses a receiving address. 

### Installation

```
$ yarn
```

### Local Development

```
$ yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.
